# H2

Supporting light weight extensions for heavy task lifting. The extensibility of H2's core enables building extensions that can provide you with small digital luxuries! Think Picture-in-picture for live streaming, youtube, images, videos or any other media source ([where it all began](https://github.com/h2org/H2)), cross-device clipboard sharing, mini games and other cool stuff.
